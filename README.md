# Trivia Game

In this project, I created a Christmas themed trivia game using bootstrap, JavaScript (setTimeout and setInterval) and jQuery. 


### How the app works

1. There are some pre-created multi-choice questiones. After the game starts, the questions will be displayed one by one and user has a certain amount of time to choose from the answers.

2. In each new game, the questions will be displayed in a random order and the position of the correct choice for each question is not fixed. (eg. for a certain question, the correct choice this round appears at A, but will appear at B next round.) 

3. Your results will be displayed at the end of the game.
