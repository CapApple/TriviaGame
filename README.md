# Trivia Game

In this project, I created a Christmas themed trivia game using bootstrap, JavaScript (setTimeout and setInterval) and jQuery. 


### How the app works

1. There are some pre-created multi-choice questiones. After the game starts, the questions will be displayed one by one and user has a certain amount of time to choose from the answers.

2. After the user make the choice, they will be told if their choice is right or wrong. If they don't make a choice within 10 seconds, they will be told that time is out and will get to the next question.

3. In each new game, the questions will be displayed in a random order and the orders of the choices for each question will be shuffled too. (eg. for a certain question, the correct choice this round appears at A, but will appear at B next round.) 

4. Your results will be displayed at the end of the game.
